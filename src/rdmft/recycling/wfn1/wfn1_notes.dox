\brief The single configuration wavefunction module

# Maybe there is a real 1-electron wavefunction #

Contrary to the discussion in the summary above there may actually be a 
way to write a single configuration 1-electron wavefunction that can
generate the exact 1-electron density matrix. In this case we start
by considering natural orbitals which are orthonormal functions that
diagonalize the density matrix. We define these functions as
\f{eqnarray*}{
   \phi^{D\sigma}_i = \sum_a \chi_a C^{D\sigma}_{a i}
\f}
where the functions \f$\chi\f$ are the atomic basis function.

We now express a single electron using an occupation function. This
occupation function expresses a single electron in terms of the
natural orbitals as
\f{eqnarray*}{
   \phi^{O\sigma}_p = \sum_i \phi^{D\sigma}_i C^{O\sigma}_{ip}
\f}
The occupation functions have the property that they are orthonormal
\f{eqnarray*}{
   (\phi^{O\sigma}_p|\phi^{O\sigma}_q) = \sum_{k=1}^{N_{basis}} C^{O\sigma}_{kp}C^{O\sigma}_{kq} = \delta_{pq}
\f}
In addition the occupation number contributions for a given electron
are given by the square of the corresponding occupation function coefficient
\f{eqnarray*}{
   (\phi^{O\sigma}_p\phi^{O\sigma}_p)_i = \left(C^{O\sigma}_{ip}\right)^2
\f}
from this it follows that the occupation number of a particular natural 
orbital is given by
\f{eqnarray*}{
   d^\sigma_{ii} = \sum_{p=1}^{n^\sigma} \left(C^{O\sigma}_{ip}\right)^2
\f}
where \f$ n^\sigma \f$ is the number of electrons in a particular spin-channel.
The critical aspect here is that the occupation function expresses the charge
distribution of a single electron as an ensemble of natural orbitals. This is
an important difference from a representation in which the occupation functions
generate a rotation amongst natural orbitals. The latter would simply result in
Hartree-Fock theory.

Formally we can consider this approach as generating an extended 1-electron vector
in which we put all the natural orbitals under each other in a vector, but every
vector is multiplied with an occupation function coefficient. I.e. we can express the
electron orbitals as
\f{eqnarray*}{

The total wavefunction can now be expressed using a Slater determinant of orbitals of the
form given above. 

In the following we will consider a few important aspects. First of all we need to verify
that the mathematics involving orbitals of the form given above reproduces the expected
results, such as orthonormality of the vectors, proper expectation values for physical 
properties, and the construction of the proper 1-electron density matrix. The next thing
to consider is whether a wavefunction of this form can be used to construct the correct
exchange term. Here the correct exchange term is one that cancels all 1-electron
self-interaction terms in the Coulomb repulsion as a minimum requirement.

First we will consider evaluating matrix expressions. There are two important cases to
consider. First we want to consider the orthonormality of the orbitals. Second in order to
evaluate 1-electron properties we need to construct the proper 1-electron density 
matrix. This matrix is relevant because it suffices to evaluate all 1-electron properties
exactly.

As far as the overlap matrix is concerned we need to show that 
\f{eqnarray*}{
  \left(\phi_p\left|\phi_q\right.\right)
  &=&  \left(\phi_p\left|S\left|\phi_q\right.\right.\right) \\\\
  &=&  \delta_{pq}
\f}
The overlap matrix \f$S\f$ represents the metric. In this case the basis functions are 
replicated \f$ N \f$ times. As a result the formal structure of the overlap matrix is
that of the traditional overlap matrix but replicated N times along the diagonal.
The block diagonal representation matches the concept of the occupation functions specifying
an ensemble of natural orbitals.
The dot-product of interest becomes:
\f{eqnarray*}{
  \left(\phi_p\left|\phi_q\right.\right)
  &=& \sum_{ij}\sum_{ab}
      \left(C^{O\sigma}_{ip}\right)^T\left(C^{D\sigma}_{a i}\right)^T \delta_{ij}S_{ab}
      C^{D\sigma}_{b j}C^{O\sigma}_{jq} \\\\
  &=& \sum_{i}\sum_{ab}
      \left(C^{O\sigma}_{ip}\right)^T\left(C^{D\sigma}_{a i}\right)^T S_{ab}
      C^{D\sigma}_{b i}C^{O\sigma}_{iq} \\\\
  &=& \sum_{i}
      \left(C^{O\sigma}_{ip}\right)^T C^{O\sigma}_{iq} \\\\
  &=& \delta_{pq}
\f}
The second equality holds because of the block diagonal nature of the metric. The third 
equality follows from the orthonormality of the natural orbitals. The
fourth equality then follows from the orthonormality of the occupation functions.

The next thing to consider is the construction of the density matrix in the basis of
atomic orbitals:
\f{eqnarray*}{
  \left|\chi_a\right\rangle\left\langle\chi_b\right|
  &=& \sum_{i=1}^{N_{basis}}\sum_{p=1}^{n^\sigma_e}
      C^{D\sigma}_{a i}C^{O\sigma}_{ip}
      \left(C^{O\sigma}_{ip}\right)^T\left(C^{D\sigma}_{ib}\right)^T \\\\
  &=& \sum_{i=1}^{N_{basis}}
      C^{D\sigma}_{a i}d^{O\sigma}_{ii}
      \left(C^{D\sigma}_{ib}\right)^T \\\\
  &=& D^{\sigma}_{ab}
\f}
This expression is in direct analogy to the usual expression involving a sum
over occupied orbitals. In this case that sum is generalized to allow every
electron to contribute a fraction of any natural orbital. Whereas before this
meant summing over products like \f$C_{a p}C_{b p}\f$ the index \f$p\f$ 
can now be considered to be generalized to include natural orbital labels as
well as electrons, i.e. \f$(ip)\f$.


The final aspect to consider is the expression for the exchange. In Hartree-Fock theory
we know the exchange can be evaluated exactly in the sense that the corresponding
exchange term cancels the Coulomb self-repulsion exactly. When the Hartree-Fock energy
is expressed in terms of density matrices this cancellation does not hold exactly except
for idem-potent density matrices. The unrestricted Hartree-Fock energy expression is
\f{eqnarray*}{
  E 
  &=& \sum_p^{N_\alpha}(p|h|p)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_p^{N_\alpha}\left\{
      \sum_q^{N_\beta}(pp|qq)+\sum_q^{N_\alpha}(pp|qq)-\sum_q^{N_\alpha}(pq|pq)\right\} \\\\
  &+& \sum_p^{N_\beta}(p|h|p)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_p^{N_\beta}\left\{
      \sum_q^{N_\alpha}(pp|qq)+\sum_q^{N_\beta}(pp|qq)-\sum_j^{N_\beta}(pq|pq)\right\}
\f}
For the above expression it is known that if we have the exact 1-electron density matrix
then only the 1-electron term \f$ h \f$ can be evaluated exactly. Both the Coulomb and the
exchange term do not match the correct result. This is examplified by a calculation on the 
Helium atom using the 6-31G basis set. In this calculation the exact results are obtained
from a CASSCF calculation using a modified version of the NWChem MCSCF module. The modifications
allow the 2-electron interaction term to be split into a Coulomb and exchange part which are
reported separately. The results can be compared against numbers for the same quantities
obtained by inserting the exact 1-electron density matrix from the CASSCF calculations
into a Hartree-Fock code.

Term       | CASSCF     | Hartree-Fock
-----------|------------|-------------
1-electron | -3.863582  | -3.863545
Coulomb    |  2.244652  |  2.034177
exchange   | -1.251232  | -1.017089
Total      | -2.870162  | -2.846456

The results above clearly show that both the Coulomb and exchange terms are significantly
modified by interdeterminantal contributions that cannot be represented directly in terms
of the 1-electron density matrix. With the appropriate density matrix functionals we might
be able to formulate an energy expression in terms of the 1-electron density matrix that can
closely represent the total energy.

Considering the 2-electron terms in the Hartree-Fock equation we have
\f{eqnarray*}{
  \sum_{p,q=1}^{n^\sigma_e}(pp|qq)
  &=& \sum_{p,q=1}^{n^\sigma_e}\sum_{i,j=1}^{N_{basis}}
      \sum_{abcd}
  C^{D}_{a i}C^{O}_{ip}C^{D}_{b i}C^{O}_{ip}(ab|cd)
  C^{D}_{c j}C^{O}_{jq}C^{D}_{d j}C^{O}_{jq} \\\\
  &=& \sum_{p,q=1}^{n^\sigma_e}\sum_{i,j=1}^{N_{basis}}
      C^O_{ip}C^O_{ip}(ii|jj)C^O_{jq}C^O_{jq}
\f}
for the Coulomb term and for the exchange
\f{eqnarray*}{
  \sum_{p,q=1}^{n^\sigma_e}(pq|pq)
  &=& \sum_{p,q=1}^{n^\sigma_e}\sum_{i,j=1}^{N_{basis}}
      \sum_{abcd}
  C^{D}_{a i}C^{O}_{ip}C^{D}_{b i}C^{O}_{iq}(ab|cd)
  C^{D}_{c j}C^{O}_{jp}C^{D}_{d j}C^{O}_{jq} \\\\
  &=& \sum_{pq}\sum_{ij}C^O_{ip}C^O_{iq}(ii|jj)C^O_{jp}C^O_{jq}
\f}
where we consider the orbital pair \f$\{pq\}\f$ as refering to a single 
electron (either electron 1 or 2 of the electron pair for which we are
calculating the interaction).
Hence evaluating the corresponding density matrix has to follow the
rule given above. This combination leads to a result that is different 
from the single determinant Hartree-Fock exchange. In particular it is clear that
if \f$ p = q \f$  the Coulomb and exchange expressions are the same and therefore
the self repulsion included in the Coulomb interaction is exactly canceled by the
exchange. 

The reason this seems to be different from Hartree-Fock theory is that in the latter
theory we always work from the total 1-electron density matrix. For the Coulomb term
that poses no problems, but for the exchange term this results in something strange. 
For the Coulomb term we evaluate a density matrix
\f{eqnarray*}{
   D &=& D(r,r')
\f}
and subsequently we evaluate the Coulomb resulsion as
\f{eqnarray*}{
  E &=& \int \frac{D(r_1,r_1)D(r_2,r_2)}{r_{12}} \mathrm{d}r_1\mathrm{d}r_2
\f}
which makes perfect sense from the perspective that the density matrix generates the
electron charge distribution. However in the exchange term we end up with
\f{eqnarray*}{
  E &=& \int \frac{D(r_1,r_2)D(r_2,r_1)}{r_{12}} \mathrm{d}r_1\mathrm{d}r_2
\f}
The fact that the density matrix now refers to two different electron coordinates
does not make any physical sense. In our approach the exchange turns out as of the form
\f{eqnarray*}{
  E &=& \int \frac{D'(r_1,r_1)D'(r_2,r_2)}{r_{12}} \mathrm{d}r_1\mathrm{d}r_2
\f}
I.e. the density matrices specify the electron charge distribution in a physically
sensible way, the difference is just that the density matrices themselves represent
different quantities. In our exchange formulation the density matrices in the exchange
each represent a single electron, rather than all electrons as in traditional 
Hartree-Fock theory.

From the above argument we have that for two electron systems, such as the Helium atom
and the Hydrogen molecule where we have only one electron per spin channel, the energy
expressions as formulated should reproduce the FullCI energy. The reason simply being
that in these systems there is only one occupied orbital and its Coulomb repulsion 
within the spin channel is exactly canceled thereby correctly eliminating the intra
spin channel electron repulsion. As a result only the inter spin channel repulsion 
remains. For systems with more than one electron per spin channel the equations above
are also easy to assess. In those case there appear to remain \f$\{pq\}\f$ terms
However, we know that the occupation functions express the density of a single electron
in terms of the orthogonal basis of natural orbitals. Hence the summations over \f$ p \f$
and \f$ q \f$ constitute simple dot-products. In addition we stipulated that the occupation
functions be orthonormal, from this it follows that if \f$ p \neq q \f$ then the result
equals 0.



Another thing that is easy to see is that if the occupation functions are simple unit
vectors (i.e. one coefficient that equals 1.0 and all other coefficients equalling 0.0)
then the above approach is identical to Hartree-Fock. This is important as it is known 
that the exact energy for idem potent density matrices or equivalently traditional 
single determinant wavefunctions is the Hartree-Fock energy. Only when we move away
from idem potent density matrices is a different exchange energy obtained. The latter
is what we hope as the Hartree-Fock exchange is under estimating the true exchange
in that case. Of course comparing the exchange expression we obtained to Hartree-Fock
it seems that there is a contradiction. In the new exchange expression it is easy to see
that if \f$ p \neq q \f$ the exchange term is 0. In Hartree-Fock theory there still are
the terms \f$ (pq|pq) \f$ which are not obviously 0. A simple way to show that these
integrals are actually 0 is to consider the number of pair interactions included in the
the law of Coulomb. The law of Coulomb states that the energy of a system of charged 
particles is given by summing the interactions of any given particle with all other
particles. This means that overall for a system of \f$ N \f$ electrons there are 
\f$ N(N-1)/2 \f$ pair interactions. The Hartree-Fock Coulomb term represents the 
interaction between two charge distributions that happen to be the same ones. That
means that this term includes self interaction terms and the number of pair interactions
included is \f$ N^2/2 \f$. Hence the Coulomb term over estimates the electron-electron
repulsion. This spurious self interaction is canceled by the exchange term. It is clear
from the form of the exchange expression that if we just take the \f$ p = q \f$ terms
then we have \f$ N/2 \f$ pair terms. Subtracting that number of pairs from the Coulomb
pairs we have \f$ N(N-1)/2 \f$ which is the correct number of pair interactions. We
also know that Hartree-Fock theory is consistent with the law of Coulomb. This means that
the remaining \f$ p \neq q \f$ terms in the exchange have to sum up to 0, otherwise the
number of pair interactions would be violated. This proves that our exchange term is 
identical to the Hartree-Fock exchange in the case of idem potent density matrices.

A further comment is that all quantities in this theory, apart from the exchange, can
be evaluated using only the total 1-electron density matrix. These quantities are therefore
independent of the occupation functions. The exchange energy is different as this depends 
explicitly on the charge distributions of single electrons. As a result the optimization
of the wavefunction includes an optimization of the occupation functions at a fixed 
density matrix to minimize the exchange term. This has obvious parallels with the
Optimized Effective Potential (OEP) methods. The difference is that traditional 
OEP methods considered electronic states that correspond to idem potent density matrices
whereas in our model any N-representable density matrix may be used.

## Optimization ##

In the previous section we discussed the energy expression of interest. Here we consider
how we can optimize the parameters in this expression. To arrive at an optimization scheme
we propose a number of Lagrangians. First the natural orbitals are a set of orthonormal vectors
\f{eqnarray*}{
  L_1 &=& \sum_{ij} \lambda^{(1)}_{ij}\left(\sum_{ab}
          C^D_{a i} S_{ab} C^D_{b j}-\delta_{ij}\right)
\f}
Just like the natural orbitals the occupation functions also are an orthonormal set
\f{eqnarray*}{
  L_2 &=& \sum_{pq\in \{occupied\}} \lambda^{(3)}_{pq}\left(\sum_{ij}
          C^O_{ip} \delta_{ij} C^O_{jq}-\delta_{pq}\right) \\\\
      &=& \sum_{pq\in \{occupied\}} \lambda^{(3)}_{pq}\left(\sum_{i}
          C^O_{ip} C^O_{iq}-\delta_{pq}\right)
\f}

To optimize the energy expression given above we need the gradient of the energy with respect
to the wavefunction coefficients. We'll discuss every different term in turn. First of all 
the 1-electron contributions to the energy can be written as:
\f{eqnarray*}{
  E^{(1)}
  &=& \sum_{\sigma ab}h_{ab}D^\sigma_{ab} \\\\
  &=& \sum_{\sigma ab}h_{ab}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{basis}}\sum_{p=1}^{n^e}
      C^{D\sigma}_{ai}C^{O\sigma}_{ip}

  &=& \sum_{\sigma ab}h_{ab}\sum_{i,j=1}^{N_{basis}}\sum_{p=1}^{n^e}\delta_{ij}

The derivatives of \f$ E^{(1)} \f$ are

      +\delta_{\sigma\sigma"}\delta_{eb}\delta_{jm}\delta_{ij}
         C^{D\sigma}_{ai}C^{O\sigma}_{ip}C^{O\sigma}_{jp}
      \right) \\\\
  &=& \sum_{ab}h_{ab}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n^e}\left(
      \delta_{ea}\delta_{mj}C^{O\sigma"}_{mp}C^{O\sigma"}_{jp}C^{D\sigma"}_{bj}

Looking over the equations derived above we note a few things:
- The form of the exchange equations ensure that for \f$ i \ne j \f$ the
  energy term as well as the corresponding gradient term are 0.
- The energy evaluation requires the 1-electron density matrices for single
  electrons as well as the total 1-electron density matrices.
- The gradient of the density matrices with respect to the natural orbital
  coefficients can be calculated and stored straightforwardly. 
- The gradient of the density matrices with respect to the occupation
  function coefficients cannot be stored explicitly as this would require
  \f$ O(N^4) \f$ storage. Hence the most efficient evaluation of the gradient
  requires contracting the matrices of the variables with the operator early.

The matrices we need are:
- The natural orbital coefficients \f$ C^{D\sigma}_{\mu k} \f$ where 
  \f$ \sigma \in \{\alpha,\beta\} \f$, \f$ \mu \f$ runs over all basis
  functions, and \f$ k \f$ runs over all natural orbitals. I.e. the natural
  orbitals are stored column-wise. Variables `g_noa` and `g_nob`.
- The occupation function coefficients \f$ C^{O\sigma}_{ki} \f$ where
  \f$ \sigma \f$, and \f$ k \f$ cover the same ranges as above. The index 
  \f$ i \f$ only runs over the occupied extended orbitals in the energy 
  expression and gradient. However, we expect some interesting features
  involving these quantities, and for now, we want to calculate the whole
  manyfold of occupation functions. The occupation functions are once again
  stored column-wise. Variables `g_ofa` and `g_ofb`.
- The Lagrangian multipliers \f$ \lambda^{(1\sigma)}_{kl} \f$ are the 
  multipliers for the orthonormality condition of the natural orbitals. Hence
  \f$ \sigma \f$ runs over the same range as above, and both \f$ k \f$ and
  \f$ l \f$ run over all natural orbitals. Variables `g_l1a` and `g_l1b`.
- The Lagrangian multipliers \f$ \lambda^{(2\sigma)}_{kl} \f$ are the
  multipliers associated with the natural orbitals being eigenfunctions of the
  density matrices. Strictly speaking we only need the Lagrangians for the
  off-diagonal terms. (I suspect these multipliers not to have any physical
  interpretation). Variables `g_l2a` and `g_l2b`.
- Finally the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the occupation functions
  come into play. Again we want to calculate all of them even though the 
  lowest occupied extended orbitals are the only ones that contribute to the
  energy expression. Variables `g_l3a` and `g_l3b`.

We also have gradients to calculate. Ultimately we want to do something like
a line search. To establish the search direction the gradient of the energy
with respect to the variables is needed. The data structures needed to store
the gradient have the same form as the variable they correspond to. E.g.
the gradient of \f$ E(C^D,C^O,L^{(1)},L^{(2)},L^{(3)}) \f$ with respect to the
variables \f$ L^{(1)}_{kl} \f$ is a quantity with the same form as
\f$ L^{(1)} \f$ itself. At this moment in time we are interested in the 
groundstate energies and its first order derivatives only. Hence we encode
the derivative by inserting a "d" in the name. I.e.
- The energy gradients with respect to `g_noa` and `g_nob` become `g_dnoa` and
  `g_dnob` respectively. 
- Likewise we get `g_dofa` and `g_dofb` with `g_ofa` and `g_ofb`.
- Also `g_dl1a` and `g_dl1b`.
- Also `g_dl2a` and `g_dl2b`.
- Also `g_dl3a` and `g_dl3b`.
This naming scheme can be extended to higher order derivatives, e.g. 
`g_dnoa_dl2b`, but needs to be modified if ever multiple electronic states were
to be considered simultaneously.

In the equations formulated above there are also a few recurring themes. These
are quantities that may be used to evaluate a number of expressions. The main
quantities in this category are the single 1-electron density matrices and 
the total 1-electron density matrices. These quantities are defined as
\f{eqnarray*}{
   D^{(1\sigma)}_{\mu\nu,i} &=& \sum_k 
      C^{D\sigma}_{\mu k}C^{O\sigma}_{ki}C^{O\sigma}_{ki}C^{D\sigma}_{\nu k}
      \\\\
   D^{(T\sigma)}_{\mu\nu} &=& \sum_{i\in\{occ\}} D^{(1\sigma)}_{\mu\nu,i}
\f}
The variables for these quantities are `g_D1a` and `g_D1b` as well as
`g_DTa` and `g_DTb`, where the `g_D1` matrices are 3D matrices with dimensions
\f$ (N_{bf},N_{bf},N_{el}) \f$.

One final quantity that recurs in a few places are the occupation numbers. The
elements of this vector are defined as
\f{eqnarray*}{
  O^{(\sigma)}_k &=& \sum_{i\in\{occ\}} C^{O\sigma}_{ki}C^{O\sigma}_{ki}
\f}
As these items are just single vectors they are kept in local memory in a 
buffer pointed to by `k_Oa` and `k_Ob`.
