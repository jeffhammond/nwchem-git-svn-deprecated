@WFN1: Compute the overlap between a pair of states

log
@I tried to see if using the overlap of the occupation functions only
instead of the full extended orbitals would work better. So far the result
was negative.

C> \brief Calculate the overlap matrix of the extended orbitals of 
C> two states
C>
C> This routine assumes there are two states and for each one a wavefunction
C> is given. In this context this subroutine calculates the overlap matrix
C> between the occupied orbitals. This information may then be used to 
C> calculate the overlap between the two states (see wfn1_overlap).
