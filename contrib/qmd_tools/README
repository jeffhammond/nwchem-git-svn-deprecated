Linking to a LAPACK library is required for compilation

Code for computing the IR spectrum and vibrational density of states from the 
time correlation functions of the dipole moment and atomic momenta, respectively.
The code has been written specifically for the xyz trajectory that is output from the
Gaussian basis set qmd module. The harmonic approximation quantum correction (see
J. Chem. Phys. 121, 3973 (2004)) is applied to the IR spectrum (the spectrum is also
ouput without the correction). If option -align is specified, every frame in the trajectory
will be aligned with the first frame and a new trajectory will be output containing 
the aligned frames.

Running the code without supplying any command line options or with option -help
will cause it to output a message giving all possible options.
